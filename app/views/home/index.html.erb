<h1>Welcome to our Intro to Rails Project!</h1>

<div>
    <p>Our Intro to Rails Project features 4 tables: Product, Customer, Dogs, and CustomerProducts. We used a mixture of Faker, CSV, and JSON files in order to fill our database. A customer will be able to buy multiple products and own multiple dogs. Many products can be bought by many customers. A dog is owned by only one customer.</p>
